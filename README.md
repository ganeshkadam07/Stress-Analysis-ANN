# Stress-Analysis-ANN
Stress Analysis using Artificial Neural Network Classifier. Stress analysis using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a machine learning approach that predicts stress levels in systems. By training an ANN on stress-related variables and their corresponding outputs, it can make accurate predictions for new input data. 
Data collection: Gather a dataset containing input features (such as material properties, geometric parameters, etc.) and corresponding stress values. The dataset should have a sufficient number of samples to represent the problem accurately.

Data preprocessing: Clean the dataset by removing any outliers, normalizing the input features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model architecture: Define the architecture of your ANN. This involves determining the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions to be used. The architecture depends on the complexity of the problem and the available data.

Model training: Train the ANN using the training dataset. During training, the model adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the difference between predicted stress values and the actual values in the training set. This process involves feeding the input features forward through the network, calculating the predicted stress values, and comparing them to the actual values using a loss function.

Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset. Measure the performance of the model by calculating various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared value.

Model optimization: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, or regularization techniques to improve its accuracy.
